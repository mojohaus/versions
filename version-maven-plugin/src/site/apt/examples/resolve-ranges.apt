Resolve ranges

  A pom may specify version ranges for certain dependencies.

+---+
  <dependencies>
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-project</artifactId>
      <version>[2.0.7, 2.0.9)</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.plexus</groupId>
      <artifactId>plexus-utils</artifactId>
      <version>[1.5.0, 1.5.1 ]</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>[3.0, 3.8.2)</version>
    </dependency>
    
  </dependencies>
+---+

  Using the resolve-ranges goal, the version ranges can be set to the specific version
  used in the build.
  
---
mvn versions:resolve-ranges
---

  The pom dependencies are modified to look like the following.

+---+
  <dependencies>
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-project</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.8</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.plexus</groupId>
      <artifactId>plexus-utils</artifactId>
      <version>1.5.1</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>3.8.1</version>
    </dependency>
    
  </dependencies>
+---+

  You can restrict which dependencies should have their ranges collapsed.  For example,
  the following will only match dependencies that match the groupId "org.codehaus.plexus" and artifactId
  "plexus-utils"

---
mvn versions:resolve-ranges -Dincludes=org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils
---

  The <<<includes>>> and <<<excludes>>> parameters follow the format <<<groupId:artifactId:type:classifier>>>.
  Use a comma separated separated list to specify multiple includes.  Wildcards (*) can also be used to match
  multiple values.
  
  This example will match anything with the groupId "org.codehaus.plexus" and anything with the groupId and 
  artifactId matching "junit".

---
mvn versions:resolve-ranges -Dincludes=org.codehaus.plexus:*,junit:junit
---

  By default, both the <<<project/dependencyManagment>>> and <<<project/dependencies>>> sections will be processed.
  You can use the <<<processDependencies>>> and <<<processDependencyManagement>>> parameters to control which sections
  are processed.

  This example will only process the <<<project/dependencyManagment>>> section of your pom:

---
mvn versions:resolve-ranges -DprocessDependencies=false
---

  While this example will only process the <<<project/dependencies>>> section of your pom:

---
mvn versions:resolve-ranges -DprocessDependencyManagement=false
---
