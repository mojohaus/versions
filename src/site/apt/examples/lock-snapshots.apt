Lock Snapshots

  If your pom contains a lot of -SNAPSHOT dependencies and those -SNAPSHOT dependencies are a moving target, it
  can sometimes be helpful to temporarily replace the -SNAPSHOT with a locked -YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS-NNN snapshot.
  In the long term, you will need to return to the -SNAPSHOT dependencies and then replace them with their
  release version, but if you need a short term semi-reproducible build, locked -SNAPSHOTs can sometimes be a
  useful hack.

  A pom will most likely specify -SNAPSHOT versions for certain dependencies.

+---+
  <dependencies>
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.cargo</groupId>
      <artifactId>cargo-core-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

  </dependencies>
+---+

  Using the <<<lock-snapshots>>> goal, the version range can be locked down to the specific timestamped snapshot
  version used in the build.
  
---
mvn versions:lock-snapshots
---

  The pom dependencies are modified to look like the following.

+---+
  <dependencies>
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.cargo</groupId>
      <artifactId>cargo-core-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-20081117.213112-16</version>
    </dependency>
    
  </dependencies>
+---+

  You can restrict which dependencies should have their -SNAPSHOT versions locked down.  For example,
  the following will only match dependencies that match the groupId "org.codehaus.plexus" and artifactId
  "plexus-utils"

---
mvn versions:lock-snapshots -Dincludes=org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils
---

  The <<<includes>>> and <<<excludes>>> parameters follow the format <<<groupId:artifactId:type:classifier>>>.
  Use a comma separated separated list to specify multiple includes.  Wildcards (*) can also be used to match
  multiple values.
  
  This example will match anything with the groupId "org.codehaus.plexus" and anything with the groupId and 
  artifactId matching "junit".

---
mvn versions:lock-snapshots -Dincludes=org.codehaus.plexus:*,junit:junit
---

  By default, both the <<<project/dependencyManagment>>> and <<<project/dependencies>>> sections will be processed.
  You can use the <<<processDependencies>>> and <<<processDependencyManagement>>> parameters to control which sections
  are processed.

  This example will only process the <<<project/dependencyManagment>>> section of your pom:

---
mvn versions:lock-snapshots -DprocessDependencies=false
---

  While this example will only process the <<<project/dependencies>>> section of your pom:

---
mvn versions:lock-snapshots -DprocessDependencyManagement=false
---
