# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What does the Versions Maven Plugin do?

The Versions Maven Plugin provides a means to update version information in a Maven project

### Why is this plugin reporting version 1.0.0.9 of foo:bar as the latest version when I can see version 1.0.0.23?

The current implementation of
[DefaultArtifactVersion](https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-artifact/xref/org/apache/maven/artifact/versioning/DefaultArtifactVersion.html)
in the core of Maven expects that version numbers will have a very specific format:

` <MajorVersion [> . <MinorVersion [> . <IncrementalVersion ] ] [> - <BuildNumber | Qualifier ]> `

Where *MajorVersion*, *MinorVersion*, *IncrementalVersion* and *BuildNumber* are all numeric and *Qualifier*
is a string. If your version number does not match this format, then the entire version number is treated as being
the *Qualifier*.

Version numbers in maven are compared using the individual components, so *MajorVersion*, *MinorVersion*,
*IncrementalVersion*, and *BuildNumber* are all compared as `Integer`s while *Qualifier* is compared as a `String`.

From the above you may have guessed neither `1.0.0.9` nor `1.0.0.23` match the exact format that Maven expects,
and as a result they are mapped as being just a *Qualifier*. String comparison will sort `1.0.0.9` > `1.0.0.23`.

If you need version numbers to be sorted "correctly" you will need to define some
[version number comparison rules](./version-rules.html).

### Why is foo:bar version x.y.z not being detected?

In order to determine what versions of an artifact are present, Maven relies on the presence of
meta-data files in the repository.  If the meta-data files are missing or contain invalid information
then Maven will not know about versions that are available in your repositories.

Here are some common reasons why your metadata can be invalid:

- You are using a local repository as a remote repository. Stop, don't do this. The local repository
  uses a separate set of metadata files from those used by a remote repository. There are tools available
  to convert a local repository into a remote repository, but you're really better off using a repository
  manager.
- Artifacts have been deployed by non-maven metadata aware tools.
- Tools that claim to be maven meta-data aware have clobbered the metadata files.

In most cases, using a repository manager will solve these issues as the repository managers usually
rebuild the metadata files based on the artifacts that are present.

### Why is a dependency version not excluded by dependencyExcludes

`dependencyIncludes` and `dependencyExcludes` work on *input* dependencies and not on <u>output</u> dependencies. That will mean that even if you include a version string you don't want the given dependency to be updated to, that version might still get chosen as the target dependency version.

The reason for that is that the option filters *input* dependency versions.

Let's suppose you wanted `org.apache.maven.doxia:doxia-core:` not to be updated to `2.0.0-M6` or `org.apache.maven:maven-core` to `4.0.0-alpha-5'  or anything with a `-M` or `-alpha' in it. Upon first sight of the `dependencyExcludes` option, one might consider to use it to filter out anything with `2.*-M.*` or `*-alpha.*`.

Well, that would be wrong. `dependencyIncludes` and `dependencyExcludes` work only on *input* dependencies, that is, dependency versions that are already being used by your project. This means that it is likely that you will still see the dreaded `2.0.0-M6`-like version in the updates.

Instead, what you should be looking at is `ruleSet` or `ignoredVersions`. The former allows for a greater control where you can specify ignored version patterns per dependency whereas the latter is intended to be used from command line and only offers simple version filters.

So, to ignore all updates with an `-M.*` at the end of the version string, simply use:

`-Dmaven.version.ignore=.*-M.*`

or:

```xml
<configuration>
    ...
    <ignoredVersions>.*-M.*</ignoredVersions>
    ...
</configuration>
```

in your project config.

See [Issue #258](https://github.com/mojohaus/versions/issues/258) and [the documentation for ignoredVersions](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/display-dependency-updates-mojo.html#ignoredVersions)
