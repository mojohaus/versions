Update Parent

  Here's an example:

---
svn checkout http://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/tags/xmlbeans-maven-plugin-2.3.1 xmlbeans-maven-plugin
cd xmlbeans-maven-plugin
mvn versions:update-parent
---

  Which produces the following output:

---

  You can restrict the versions to be considered:

---
mvn versions:update-parent "-DparentVersion=[14,16)"
---

  Note that, by default, -SNAPSHOT versions are ignored. You can force snapshots to be 
  included with the allowSnapshots parameter:

---
mvn versions:update-parent -DallowSnapshots=true
---
