# MojoHaus Versions Maven Plugin - JGit PoC

This is an updated version of [versions-maven-plugin](http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/)
with a jGit hack to perform commit based on properties update (`mvn versions:update-properties`)
 
 
### JGIT

Introduced JGIT in in order to be able to produce a branch containing the commits for each property updated when using the maven plugin.

As I tested Renovate bot and it seems the security around credentials and git is not following our workflow,
I'd choose JGIT to manage the local commits.

#### How it works?

- Compile the project and make sure there is no upper version of the Versions Maven Plugin in your .m2 folder
- Run the command from your project - on master:
`mvn versions:update-properties -Dmaven.version.rules=file:///path_to_rules_file -DgenerateBackupPoms=false`

Once executed:
- it will create a branch named "dependencies-updates" in the local directory where you launched the plugin.
- create a commit for each properties updated. If the release notes are located in the files, it creates a commit message containing the link to the release notes (which match the version update) or changelogs.


- It leaves your local repository safe: do not ask for email/user/authentication... everything is local.
- It leaves you the choice to rebase your commits and choose what updates you want to keep or not.

#### Only a PoC

This is only a poc, tested locally for now and working ok even if there is a few issues:
- code is not pretty - as it is only works with the update-properties, the project should be renamed and cleared.
- commit only the pom file(s) (actually commit everything is not stashed!)
- The release notes/changelogs files need to be updated/completed and the commit message should follow a pattern in a more flexible way instead of static code.
- only tested with `mvn versions:update-properties -Dmaven.version.rules=<file_location> -DgenerateBackupPoms=false`
See https://github.com/violette/utility-scripts/blob/master/update-mavendependencies.md

Tested with:
- JDK version "11.0.11"
- Apache Maven 3.6.3

Examples:
`mvn versions:update-properties  -Dmaven.version.rules=<path_to_rules> -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DincludeProperties=mockito.version,testng.version,slf4j.version`
