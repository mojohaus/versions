Usage

  The plugin offers goals for updating the versions of artifacts referenced in
  a maven pom.xml file.

* Basic Usage

  Maven 2.0 does not currently support re-reading modifications of the pom.xml within the one invocation of Maven.
  As the {{{update-parent.html}prefix:update-parent}} and {{{update-properties.html}prefix:update-properties}} goals
  modify the pom.xml file, you need to run these goals separately from any other goals or life-cycle phases.

** Updating the parent version

  To update the parent version of your pom to the latest available, just invoke the update-parent goal.

---
mvn versions:update-parent
---

  {{{examples/update-parent.html} A more detailed example of the update-parent goal}}.

** Checking for new versions of plugins

  To get information about newer versions of plugins that you are using in your build, just invoke the
  display-plugin-updates goal.

---
mvn version:display-plugin-updates
---

  {{{examples/display-plugin-updates.html} A more detailed example of the display-plugin-updates goal}}.

** Checking for new versions of dependencies

  To get information about newer versions of dependencies that you are using in your build, just invoke the
  display-dependency-updates goal.

---
mvn version:display-dependency-updates
---

  {{{examples/display-dependency-updates.html} A more detailed example of the display-dependency-updates goal}}.

** Updating versions specified by properties

  This goal helps when you use properties to define versions.  Please see the
  {{{examples/update-properties.html}update-properties example}}
