# Recording Changes

Here's an example:

```sh
mvn versions:use-latest-releases -DchangeRecorderFormat=xml
```

Which writes a file to `target/versions-changes.xml` that looks something like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<updates xmlns="http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/schema/updates/2.0">
  <dependencyUpdate kind="dependency-update"
                    artifactId="dummy-api"
                    groupId="localhost"
                    newVersion="3.0"
                    oldVersion="1.1.1-2"/>
  <propertyUpdate property="revision"
                  newValue="3.0"
                  oldValue="3.1"/>
</updates>
```

The contents of this file records the fact that `localhost:dummy-api:1.1.1-2`
was upgraded to `3.0` and that the property `revision` changed its value from `3.0` to `3.1`.
